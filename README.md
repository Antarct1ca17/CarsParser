# CarsParser
For this project, I used 3 libraries, I could do without csv, but I thought that the information would look much worse in a simple text file.
You can add more information to the headers from the network tab, depending on how much the site allows itself to be scraped. I was hoping that I wouldn't have to use a proxy.
When paginating, I usually use the "while True" construct so that the parsing occurs until the last page, however this site allows you to enter any value for "page" and will return the last page.
There are cases where machines do not have "Fueltype", and in order not to make an "IF-ELSE" construction, I decided to ignore such instances.
In general, the project turned out to be very interesting for me.
